# Cooking Knowledge Base

## Basic Cooking Techniques

### Sautéing
Sautéing is a cooking method that uses a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow pan over relatively high heat. The key to successful sautéing is to keep the food moving in the pan. This technique is perfect for vegetables, small pieces of meat, and seafood. Always heat the pan first, then add oil, and wait until it shimmers before adding ingredients.

### Roasting
Roasting is a dry-heat cooking method that uses hot air to cook food evenly on all sides. Roasting is ideal for large cuts of meat, whole poultry, and vegetables. Preheat your oven to 375-450°F (190-230°C) depending on what you're cooking. Use a roasting pan and allow air circulation around the food for even cooking.

### Braising
Braising combines both dry and moist heat cooking methods. First, sear the food at high temperature, then finish cooking in a covered pot with liquid at lower temperature. This technique is perfect for tough cuts of meat and root vegetables, resulting in tender, flavorful dishes.

### Blanching
Blanching involves briefly boiling food and then plunging it into ice water to stop the cooking process. This technique is commonly used for vegetables to preserve color, texture, and nutritional value. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add vegetables for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to ice water immediately.

### Grilling
Grilling uses direct heat from below to cook food quickly. It's perfect for steaks, burgers, vegetables, and seafood. Preheat your grill to high heat, clean the grates, and oil them lightly to prevent sticking. Create different heat zones for better control.

## Essential Ingredients

### Olive Oil
Extra virgin olive oil is a staple in many cuisines. It's rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. Use it for sautéing, dressing salads, and finishing dishes. Store in a cool, dark place to maintain quality.

### Garlic
Garlic is a fundamental aromatic used worldwide. It adds depth and flavor to countless dishes. Mince it for maximum flavor release, slice it for milder taste, or roast whole cloves for sweet, nutty flavor. Fresh garlic is more pungent than pre-minced varieties.

### Salt
Salt is essential for enhancing flavors. Kosher salt is preferred by many chefs for its coarse texture and pure taste. Sea salt offers mineral complexity. Always taste and adjust seasoning throughout cooking, not just at the end.

### Black Pepper
Freshly ground black pepper adds heat and aromatic complexity. Always grind it fresh for maximum flavor. White pepper is milder and used in light-colored dishes.

### Onions
Onions are a foundational ingredient in many cuisines. Yellow onions are all-purpose, red onions are great raw in salads, and white onions are crisp and sharp. Caramelized onions add sweet depth to dishes.

### Butter
Butter adds richness and flavor to dishes. Unsalted butter gives you control over seasoning. Use it for sautéing (watch for burning), baking, and finishing sauces. Clarified butter has a higher smoke point.

### Stock
Good stock is the foundation of soups, sauces, and many dishes. Chicken, beef, vegetable, and fish stocks each have their uses. Homemade stock is superior but quality store-bought versions work well.

Return beef to pot, add stock, herbs. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered for 1.5 hours. Add carrots and potatoes, cook another 45 minutes until vegetables are tender and meat is falling apart.

## Knife Skills

### Proper Knife Grip
Hold the knife with your thumb and index finger gripping the blade just in front of the handle. Your other three fingers wrap around the handle. This gives you maximum control and precision.

### The Claw Technique
When cutting, curl your fingertips inward like a claw to hold the food. Your knuckles should guide the knife blade. This protects your fingertips from cuts.

### Dicing Onions
Cut the onion in half through the root. Peel outer layers. Make horizontal cuts parallel to the cutting board, then vertical cuts perpendicular to the board, and finally slice across to create dice. Keep the root end intact until the last cuts.

### Mincing Garlic
Crush the clove with the flat side of your knife to remove the skin. Roughly chop, then use a rocking motion with your knife, gathering the garlic back into a pile and repeating until finely minced.

## Baking Basics

### Understanding Leavening Agents
Baking powder contains both acid and base, activated by moisture and heat. Baking soda requires an acidic ingredient (buttermilk, lemon juice) to activate. Yeast is a living organism that produces CO2 through fermentation.

### Measuring Ingredients
Use dry measuring cups for flour, sugar, etc. Level off with a straight edge. Use liquid measuring cups for liquids - check at eye level. Weigh ingredients for most accurate results.

### Butter Temperature
Room temperature butter (65-68°F) is crucial for proper creaming in cakes and cookies. Cold butter is essential for flaky pie crusts and biscuits. Melted butter creates denser, chewier textures.

### Oven Temperature
Always preheat your oven for at least 15-20 minutes. Use an oven thermometer to verify actual temperature. Ovens can be off by 25-50°F. Baking times are guidelines - visual and textural cues are more reliable.

## Food Safety

### Temperature Guidelines
Poultry: 165°F (74°C) internal temperature. Ground meats: 160°F (71°C). Whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb: 145°F (63°C) with 3-minute rest. Fish: 145°F (63°C). Always use a meat thermometer.

### Cross-Contamination Prevention
Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and produce. Wash hands thoroughly after handling raw meat. Clean and sanitize surfaces that contact raw meat. Store raw meat on bottom shelf of refrigerator.

### Storage Times
Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours. Most cooked foods last 3-4 days refrigerated. Raw ground meat: 1-2 days. Raw poultry: 1-2 days. Cooked poultry: 3-4 days. When in doubt, throw it out.

## Seasoning and Flavor Building

### Layering Flavors
Build flavor in stages. Season at multiple points during cooking, not just at the end. Toast spices to release oils. Deglaze pans to capture fond (browned bits). Finish dishes with fresh herbs, acid (lemon juice, vinegar), or fat (butter, oil).

### Salt Types
Table salt: Fine grain, good for baking. Kosher salt: Coarse, easy to pinch, preferred for cooking. Sea salt: Mineral-rich, finishing salt. Flaky salt: Delicate texture, garnish.

### Acid Balance
Acid brightens flavors and balances richness. Lemon juice, vinegar, wine, and tomatoes add acidity. Add at the end of cooking to preserve brightness. Too much fat or richness? Add acid to balance.

### Herbs and Spices
Dried herbs and spices: Add early in cooking to develop flavors. Fresh herbs: Add at the end to preserve delicate flavors and color. Toast whole spices before grinding for enhanced aroma.

## Common Cooking Mistakes

### Overcrowding the Pan
When sautéing or searing, leave space between pieces. Overcrowding causes steaming instead of browning. Cook in batches if necessary for proper caramelization.

### Not Preheating
Always preheat your pan, oven, or grill. Cold pans cause food to stick and steam. Proper preheating ensures even cooking and good texture.

### Cooking Cold Meat
Bring meat to room temperature 30-60 minutes before cooking for even cooking. Cold meat will cook unevenly - burnt outside, raw inside.

### Over-Stirring
Let food sit undisturbed to develop proper browning. Constant stirring prevents caramelization. Only stir when necessary.

### Not Tasting
Taste throughout the cooking process. Adjust seasoning as you go. Final taste before serving is essential.
